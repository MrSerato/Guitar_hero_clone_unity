This repo contains files contained in a self-designed Guitar Hero-esque video game playable on the Unity engine. 
Game currently contains two playable songs from the Sonic the Hedgehog video game and TV series.

All development and coding was done by me. All sprites, music used, and background art are property of their respective artists and the game was created purely for educational, non-commercial use.
